I spent countless hours with games like Pok√©mon, Zelda, Halo and Fable. \
Gaming has been a hobby and personal passion of mine ever since."

Afterwards I enrolled in a one-year musical theatre course and then decided to apply to a proper theatre school. \
I heard that Lahti had one program that was about to be shut down ‚Äî this was the final year they‚Äôd hold entrance exams. \
I took a shot, got in, and spent four years studying singing, dancing, and acting."

I later landed roles in Turku (Viimeinen Laiva, 2017), Helsinki (Musta Saara, 2018), and Tampere (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, 2019). \
During this time I also started my voice acting career, narrating over 100 audiobooks and voicing characters like Shadow the Hedgehog (Sonic 3, 2024) and Varl (LEGO Horizon Adventures, 2024). \
Voice acting for animated series and games is another love of mine - something I still do nearly every week."

We aimed to create original musical theatre about contemporary topics and did everything ourselves ‚Äî writing, composing, choreographing, and performing. \
I led the group for six years, producing five professional shows. On top of the creative work, my responsibilities included budgeting, communications, HR, marketing, and creative leadership ‚Äî most of which I learned on the go! \
Today, Musiikkiteatteri NYT is well known across Finland and has performed in most of the country‚Äôs major theatres."

I began exploring new opportunities in 2021 and eventually discovered Hive Helsinki: a fast-paced, peer-driven coding school. \
I took part in the four-week entry exam (called \"Piscine\") in the summer of 2023, got selected, and started the program later that year. \
It was the perfect moment to pause my theatre journey and jump into this new exciting adventure."

I dove deep into C and C++ projects, learning the fundamentals of programming ‚Äî from memory management and optimized algorithms to multithreading, virtual machines, and Docker. \
But game development excited me the most. I completed three game-related projects at Hive, and built my own games on the side to deepen my skills. \
A new dream was born: combining my enthusiasm for creative work and coding as a game developer."

The work is definitely rewarding, and I learn something new every day! In my free time, I've had all sorts of coding projects going... like this portfolio app for instance. \
I'm also soon about to release new games too, so stay tuned! üòç"
